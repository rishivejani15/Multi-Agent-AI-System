# Multi-Agent AI System Evaluation Results

## Evaluation Goals

### Goal 1:

**"Find the next SpaceX launch, check weather at that location, then summarize if it may be delayed."**

#### Expected Plan:

* `PlannerAgent` generates: `['SpaceXAgent', 'WeatherAgent', 'NewsAgent', 'AnalyzerAgent', 'GoalCheckerAgent']`

### Iteration Trace:

#### Iteration 1:

* `SpaceXAgent`: ✅ Returned mission name and site coordinates
* `WeatherAgent`: ✅ Returned current weather at site (Rain, 28°C)
* `NewsAgent`: ✅ Returned 5 recent headlines related to SpaceX
* `AnalyzerAgent`: ✅ Predicted **Possible Delay** due to rain
* `GoalCheckerAgent`: ✅ Goal Met

### Output:

```
Mission: Starlink-10
Date: 2025-06-15T10:30:00Z
Weather: Rain - 28°C
News: 5 headlines found
Analysis: Launch may be delayed due to weather conditions.
Result: Goal Achieved ✅
```

## Mock Evaluation 2:

### Goal:

**"Find next SpaceX launch and assess if weather will impact it."**

### Planner Output:

* `['SpaceXAgent', 'WeatherAgent', 'AnalyzerAgent', 'GoalCheckerAgent']`

#### Iteration 1:

* Weather was `Clear`
* Analyzer said no delay likely
* GoalChecker returned `Goal Met`
